If you are anything like me, you are hoarding huge amount of data that you cringe at letting go. You know like everything from rare `mp3s` 🎧, music videos that once aired on MTV 💿, home movies 🏡, DSLR `raw` images 📸. The problem is that all this data-hoarding eats away at your precious local storage space.
